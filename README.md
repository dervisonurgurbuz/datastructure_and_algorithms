# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository**! 🚀  
This repository is a collection of JavaScript-based solutions for data structures and algorithms. It is designed for anyone looking to enhance their programming skills, prepare for technical interviews, or tackle coding challenges.

## 🌟 Features

- **Organized Codebase**:  
  - **Data Structures**: Implementations like hash tables.  
  - **Algorithms**:  
    - Examples: Practical problem-solving techniques (e.g., sliding window).  
    - Mathematical: Core algorithms (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci).  
    - Sorting: Classic algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort.  
- **Optimized and Readable Code**: Clean, well-documented, and efficient implementations.  
- **Learning-Oriented**: Every file includes comments and explanations to deepen your understanding.  
- **Extensible**: Expand the repository by adding more examples or algorithms.
